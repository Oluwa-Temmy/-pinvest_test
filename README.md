## üßê Why Pinvestigator <a name = "about"></a>

I've had this project on my mind for about 2-3 months before I initially created the repo on November 3rd, 2022 and began working on the project In January 2023. My goal for this project is to be able to involve the community to solve crimes in Chicago, then eventually the whole of the US and maybe used in other countries.
